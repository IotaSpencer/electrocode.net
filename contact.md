# About ElectroCode
<div class="text-light">
ElectroCode is Ken Spencer's (IotaSpencer's) 'Company' that houses some of his coding projects and endeavors.

Ken is {{}}33 years old and lives in New York State. He is a high-functioning autistic and has ADHD.

He loves programming and scripting, especially being able to make his own little utility scripts, whether he *really* needs them or not. 'Why?' You may ask.. Because to him, coding and programming is actually fun in most circumstances.

Unless he is deeply down, programming is his goto for winding down after a hard day. When he programs he usually listen to EDM or Dubstep to make parts of his mind occupied, and then he can code away.  He also loves watching youtube videos to calm himself down after a hard day, mostly when he can't think of anything coding related to work on.
